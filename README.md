# Speech Recognition System üó£Ô∏è

This project is a Speech Recognition System that includes two main functionalities: Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Web. The system uses Python libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion, enabling users to interact with their computer using voice commands.

## Introduction

The Speech Recognition System is designed to allow users to convert spoken words into text and to open websites using voice commands. By leveraging the capabilities of the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries, this system provides a hands-free experience for interacting with a computer.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition API.
- **Speech-to-Web**: Opens websites based on voice commands.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech_recognition_system.git
   cd speech_recognition_system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pipwin
   pipwin install pyaudio
   ```

## Usage

### Speech-to-Text

The Speech-to-Text functionality converts spoken words into text and then reads the text back to the user.

1. Run the `speech_to_text.py` script:
   ```bash
   python speech_to_text.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to speak into the microphone.

### Speech-to-Web

The Speech-to-Web functionality listens for a website name and opens the specified website in the default web browser.

1. Run the `speech_to_web.py` script:
   ```bash
   python speech_to_web.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to speak into the microphone and specify the website to open.
